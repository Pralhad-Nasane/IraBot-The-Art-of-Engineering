                    <h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>
                    <p>Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on data and algorithms to
                        enable machines to learn a task with minimal human intervention.
                    </p>
                    <p>Machine learning is modern innovation that has enhanced day to day life. It's a subset of
                        artificial intelligence (AI), which focuses on using statistical techniques to build intelligent
                        computer systems to learn from available databases..</p>

                    <h2>Why this course?</h2>
                    <p>This course would start from scratch, if you wanted to learn machine learning we will provide you
                        guidance about how to start then will give you practical project based insights of machine
                        learning so that you will be able to build ML project, once you will be able to develop ML
                        projects you can definitely clear ML interviews. </p>
